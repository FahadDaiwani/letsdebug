- Checkers to add:
  - CAA (added, but needs review)
  - 10 second deadline
  - Rate Limit is exceeded (use crt.sh public postgres interface)
  - Bad redirect (non-acceptable port)
  - Bad redirect (missing trailing slash on a 301 causing example.com.well-known/acme-challenge)
  - Cloudflare
  - Listening on 443 with HTTP
  - Possible missing exclusion for /.well-known/acme-challenge in webserver based on sniffing
